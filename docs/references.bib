  abstract = {Population decline in once vibrant cities has introduced challenges to managing civil infrastructure. These challenges, such as fiscal constraints, reduced personnel, and increasing regulatory standards, are identified in this article in the context of water and wastewater infrastructures when cities do not follow a trajectory of growth. Following the discussion surrounding consequential issues arising from urban decline, retooling alternatives to mitigate challenges are explored. The study uses a mixed method approach, incorporating qualitative analyses of data collected from 4 U.S. shrinking cities, subject matter expert interviews, and statistical analyses of survey data from residents of 21 U.S. shrinking cities. Our analysis indicates that more than 70\% of residents are willing to pay increased rates for improved services that may be accomplished through implementing retooling alternatives. Statistical modeling is used to identify the demographic variables that increase an individual’s propensity toward implementing five alternatives, revealing city-specify variations in support for different alternatives.},

  abstract = {Infrastructure tells a material story of ongoing challenges in cities, reflecting the diverse, normative desires of different communities. In this article we examine the introduction of green infrastructure technologies into urban infrastructure systems to think critically about these challenges and desires. Green infrastructure is an intentionally designed, multifunctional technology that directly uses or mimics the ecological processes of soils and plants (e.g., green rooftops, rain gardens, and bioswales). Facing budget shortfalls as well as demands to mitigate hazards and green the city, urban leaders are looking at green infrastructure as a facility that can provide diverse cobenefits along with traditional services. A focus on stormwater-based metrics, however—effectively reframing green infrastructure as green stormwater infrastructure—discursively tamps down alternative politics and desires for the city. Through a case study of Pittsburgh’s stormwater governance, we argue that the work to (re)technologize green infrastructure as green stormwater infrastructure is an act of depoliticization that hinders needed conversations about just infrastructure outcomes. We draw on themes from qualitative interviews with community members engaged in urban water governance to suggest that these moments of transition provide an opportunity to illuminate previously obscured infrastructure politics and challenge the forms of knowledge that bind us to conventional routines of urban environmental governance. We see an opportunity to reframe the conversation in a way that opens up opportunities for historically disenfranchised communities to voice their needs beyond the technocratic problem of stormwater management.},

  abstract = {With declining federal assistance for essential infrastructure upgrades, water and wastewater utilities have increasingly relied on customer revenue to fill funding gaps. This has led most recently to "water crises" in cities such as Baltimore and Detroit, where residents who cannot afford to pay increasing rates have been disconnected from water services altogether. Although utility disconnection is a common practice to collect unpaid revenue, the scale and duration of these shut-offs is unprecedented, and, in both cases, the result of concurrent urban fiscal and social crises. In the absence of legislation that secures the right to water for all American citizens, people addressing the problems have typically tried to identify sources of infrastructure funding that would be more equitable, or calculate levels of payment that are truly affordable. In light of these debates, this thesis asks whether processes of deliberation between the government and the public might serve a critical role in alleviating the problem. After investigating Baltimore's financial structures and exploring causes of confrontation between the public and the utility, this thesis suggests transparency and accountability reforms that enhance planning processes which involve citizens so Baltimore's DPW can move beyond the practice of just counting meters, to one of seeing and hearing customers. The thesis argues that, short of improving the infrastructure, the processes of citizen engagement, particularly via the collaboration of various state and utility departments, will help improve the technical and financial efficiency of the utility and create greater equity for customers through providing data and records that bolster various processes and programs, from account classification to collection to customer assistance to information about cognate programs such as affordable housing -- all of which will make it easier to assess and determine equity. The ultimate goal is to meet the financial and physical needs of water and wastewater utilities, while also addressing issues of equity, with a focus on deliberation and data collection that places an emphasis on process that leads to both desired outcomes.},

While racial discrimination is against black workers, spatial discrimination (or redlining) is against residents living in the city-center. When the relative access cost for black workers to employment centers is sufficiently large, a city is segregated by race. When the relative access cost is sufficiently small, a city is segregated by employment status. By examining the interaction between land and labor markets, the authors find that both race and space are responsible for the high unemployment rate among blacks.},
