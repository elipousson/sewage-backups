# Sewage Backups in Baltimore

An analysis of basement sewage backups in Baltimore focused on 311 service request data.

Erin Burman and Eli Pousson developed this analysis for Blue Water Baltimore in February and March 2020 as part of the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health course, “Community-Driven Epidemiology and Environmental Justice,” taught by Dr. Christopher D. Heaney.

Eli Pousson adapted the report on this analysis as the RMarkdown website in this repository in April 2020 for the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health course, “Methods for Assessing Power, Privilege, and Public Health in the U.S.,” taught by Dr. Lorraine Dean.
